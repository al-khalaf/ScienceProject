            <p class='margin-top margin-auto'>Sustainable consumption has been defined already very early
                 in explicit relation to the life cycle perspective: “The use of services and related products which
                  respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while mini	mixing the use of natural 
                  resources and toxic materials as well as emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of
                   the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of future generations
                Each year, an estimated one third of all food produced – equivalent to 1.3 billion tons worth around
                 $1 trillion – ends up rotting in the bins of consumers and retailers, or spoiling due to poor
                  transportation and harvesting practices or because of our discontent to the food.
                If people worldwide switched to energy efficient light bulbs the world would save US$120 billion
                 annually.

            <p class="card-title margin-top text center-align">The extent of the problem and its major consequences</p>
            <p class='margin-top margin-auto'>The increased concentration of chemicals,
                 such as nitrogen and phosphorus, in the coastal ocean promotes the growth of algal blooms, 
                 which can be toxic to wildlife and harmful to humans. 
                 The negative effects on health and the environment caused by algal blooms 
                 hurt local fishing and tourism industries
                Making plastic is one way step, you can only go out, you can’t go in with it,
               Other specific effects of ocean pollution on sea life include: Oil covering the feathers of birds 
               and the gills of fish. Skin and eye irritation and lung and liver problems from oil deposits and
                byproducts. Reproductive system failure from exposure to poisonous industrial and agricultural 
                chemicals

        <br>
        <p class="text">overproduction is a major global issue, and that's because there is a lot of plastic that is throw overproduction,
            and plastic's effects are a lot, first it is hard to be recycled, and when it is recycled it produces gases that makes
            "Climate Change" which is a global issue by itself, and it also affects the fish, a lot of fish died because it ate plastic
            thinking it as their food, and its consequences are concentration of chemicals, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, in the coastal 
            ocean promotes the growth of algal blooms, which can be toxic to wildlife and harmful to humans.</p>
